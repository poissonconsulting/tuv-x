Quantum Yields
--------------

The base functionality for quantum yield calculations is described in
``src/quantum_yield.F90``. The base quantum yield type ``quantum_yield_t``
defined in this module includes a constructor that reads a set of
NetCDF files specified in the configuration JSON object as an
array of file paths with the key ``netcdf files`` if present, or
can set the value of the quantum yield to a constant when the
``constant value`` key is present and set to a real number.

Here is an example configuration for a quantum yield:

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
     "type": "base",
     "constant value": 1.0
   }


Data from each NetCDF file will be loaded into an element of the
``quantum_yield_parms`` data member. If a NetCDF variable named
``quantum_yield_parameters`` is present, it will be used to populate
the ``array(:,:)`` data member of the ``quantum_yield_parms_t`` object.
This first dimension of the array is wavelength, and will be interpolated
to the native TUV-x wavelength grid if this differs from the wavelength
grid in the netcdf file (named ``wavelength``). The second dimension
is used to accomodate multiple wavelength-resolved parameters for
quantum yield calculations.

If a NetCDF variable named ``temperature`` is present, it will be
used to populate the ``temperature(:)`` data member of the
``quantum_yield_parms_t`` object.

The calculation of quantum yields is done by calling the ``calculate()``
type-bound procedure on a ``quantum_yield_t`` object.

The base-class calculation of quantum yields returns the
wavelength-interpolated first parameter (``array(:,1)``) from the first
NetCDF file (``quantum_yield_parms(1)``) specified in the configuration
data.

Quantum yield subclasses are located in the ``src/quantum_yields/`` folder.
These each provide unique algorithms for calculating quantum yields.

Before adding a new quantum yield class, first check to make sure there
is not an existing class that can be configured to accomodate your
needs. If you find that an existing quantum yield subclass could be used
by moving one or more hard-coded parameters to the configuration data, this
is preferable to adding a new subclass.

If you determine that a new quantum yield subclass is needed, this can be
done in three steps:

- :ref:`qy-create-subclass`
- :ref:`qy-add-to-build-scripts`
- :ref:`qy-add-to-factory`
- :ref:`qy-create-unit-test`

.. _qy-create-subclass:

Create subclass module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, choose a unique name for your quantum yield calculation. Ideally,
this name will describe the algorithm, rather than the specific photolysis
reaction you are applying it to. However, many subclasses currently in TUV-x
are named for specific photolysis reactions. For this example, we will use
the name ``foo`` for our quantum yield algorithm.

**Pay special attention to naming of files, modules, types, and functions
in these instructions.**

Create a file to hold your new subclass module in ``src/quantum_yields/`` named
``foo.F90``. The general layout of the module will be (comments have been omitted
for this example, but should be included in an actual module):

The constructor function is reponsible for initializing new instances of your
quantum yield subclass. First, you allocate the pointer to be returned as
your new type (``quantum_yield_foo_t`` in this example). Then you initialize
its data members. If you just want to use the default initialization of the
base class, you can call the ``base_constructor()`` function as shown above.
You can alternatively initialize data members of the base class
(``quantum_yield_parms(:)``) directly in this function or add data members
to your subclass and initialize them here (see
``src/quantum_yields/tint.F90`` for an example).

The run function overrides the base-class run function and will be called when
a user calls the ``calculate()`` type-bound procedure on an instance of your
new subclass. You can access grid and profile data from the "warehouse" objects
passed in as function arguments, and any data in the base-class data members
or in data members you've added to your subclass to perform your calculations.
See the files in ``src/quantum_yields/`` for examples of how to access this
data in the ``run()`` function.

.. _qy-add-to-build-scripts:

Add subclass module to build scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To include your new class in the build, edit the ``src/quantum_yields/CMakeLists.txt``
file and add your file name to the list saved to ``SRC``. Files are listed in
alphabetical order.

.. code-block:: cmake
   :emphasize-lines: 12

   set(SRC acetone-ch3co_ch3.F90
        c2h5cho.F90
        ch2chcho.F90
        ch2o.F90
        ch3cho-ch3_hco.F90
        ch3coch2ch3-ch3co_ch2ch3.F90
        ch3cocho.F90
        clo-cl_o1d.F90
        clo-cl_o3p.F90
        clono2-clo_no2.F90
        clono2-cl_no3.F90
        foo.F90
        ho2-oh_o.F90
        mvk.F90
        no2_tint.F90
        no3_aq.F90
        o3-o2_o1d.F90
        o3-o2_o3p.F90
        tint.F90
        )

.. _qy-add-to-factory:

Add subclass to factory function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use your new subclass, you will need to add it to the
``tuvx_quantum_yield_factory`` module in ``src/quantum_yield_factory.F90``.
First use-associate your new class at the module level:

.. code-block:: fortran

   use tuvx_quantum_yield_foo,            only : quantum_yield_foo_t

Then, inside the ``quantum_yield_builder()`` function, add these lines to the
``select case`` block:

.. code-block:: fortran

   case( 'foo' )
     quantum_yield => quantum_yield_foo_t( config, grid_warehouse,              &
                                           profile_warehouse )

Now, when you add a quantum yield of type ``foo`` to the configuration data,
an instance of your new subclass will be created.

.. _qy-create-unit-test:

Create unit test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last step to adding a quantum yield is to create a unit test. This will ensure
that your calculations are doing what you intended. It will also serve as an example
for how users can configure and use your new subclass.

.. note::

   Add instructions for creating quantum yield tests when tests for existing classes
   have been added.

Test Creation
-------------

Unit tests are required for all new code contributions.
Source code for new unit tests should be added to the ``test/unit/`` folder
or one of its sub-folders depending on the module being tested.
Unit tests are typically Fortran programs that are linked to the ``tuv-x``
library and test the components of a single Fortran module in the ``src/``
tree.

An example of a  unit test for the fictitous ``foo`` module is shown below.

.. code-block:: fortran

   program test_foo

     implicit none

     call test_foo_t( )

   contains

   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     subroutine test_foo_t( )
       ! Tests the foo_t type

       use musica_assert,              only : assert_msg
       use tuvx_foo,                   only : foo_t

       type(foo_t) :: my_foo

       call assert( 501352581, my_foo%do_bar( ) .eq. 12.5 )
       call assert( 503258115, my_foo%do_baz( ) .eq. "qux" )

     end subroutine test_foo_t

   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   end program test_foo


The `musica_assert <https://ncar.github.io/musica-core/html/namespacemusica__assert.html>`_
module contains a number of functions that can be useful in
unit tests.

You will need to modify the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in the
folder where you saved your test source code (for this example we assume the above
file is named ``test_foo.F90``) to include your new source in the build, and
your test in the test suite.
An updated ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for the ``foo`` test is shown below.


.. code-block:: cmake

   ################################################################################
   # Test utilities

   include(test_util)

   ################################################################################
   # Photo-decomp tests

   create_standard_test(NAME some_existing_test SOURCES test_bar.F90)
   create_standard_test(NAME foo SOURCES test_foo.F90)

   ################################################################################


The ``create_standard_test()`` CMake function adds your new executable to the build,
links it to the ``tuv-x`` library, and includes the test as well as a
memory check of your test to the testing suite.
The function is defined in ``cmake-modules/test_util.cmake``, but can generally used
as shown above.

If your test needs access to data files, you can place these in the ``test/data/``
folder.
By default, your test executable will be run in the build folder and can access
data files you place in this folder using a relative path: ``test/data/my_foo_data.txt``.
